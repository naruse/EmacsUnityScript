This is an emacs mode  for coloring the Runtime and Editor API calls in Javascript for Unity 3.x

To make it work, just add this to your .emacs:
;; UnityJS mode for emacs
(autoload ‘unityjs-mode “unityjs-mode” “Major mode for editing Unity script code.” t)
(require ‘unityjs-mode)

And make sure to load the path where you are going to store the .el file.
